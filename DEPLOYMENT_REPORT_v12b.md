# Deployment Report v12b - General Criteria Logic Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Critical Logic Bug**: Companies that failed general criteria were still being processed through qualification, mandatory, and NTH analysis stages, wasting computational resources and providing misleading results.

## Root Cause
In `services/criteria_processor/src/core/parallel_processor.py`, function `process_single_company_for_product()`:
- The system correctly retrieved `general_passed` status (line 55)
- But there was NO early exit check for failed general criteria
- Processing continued to qualification analysis regardless of general criteria results

## Solution Implemented
Added critical early exit logic after general criteria evaluation:

```python
# CRITICAL: If general criteria failed, stop processing immediately
if not general_passed:
    log_info(f"❌ [{product}] {company_name} НЕ ПРОШЛА general критерии - ПРЕРЫВАЕМ анализ")
    record["Qualified_Products"] = "NOT QUALIFIED - Failed General Criteria"
    record["All_Results"] = product_results
    return [record]
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **General Criteria Pass**: Continue to qualification → mandatory → NTH analysis
2. **General Criteria Fail**: 
   - Immediately return "NOT QUALIFIED - Failed General Criteria"
   - Skip qualification questions entirely
   - Skip mandatory criteria analysis
   - Skip NTH criteria analysis
   - Save computational resources

## Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `services/criteria_processor/src/core/parallel_processor.py`
- **Lines Added**: 4 lines of early exit logic
- **Docker Image**: `sergeykostichev/company-canvas-app:v12b`
- **Image Digest**: `sha256:72772d2abaaf58a20b4e4613e238cdbd6832f6718a9b4b3e6069d610c8f4f8ea`
- **Build Time**: ~7.6 seconds (cached layers)
- **Image Size**: ~679MB

## Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Significant reduction in API calls and processing time for companies failing general criteria
- **Resource Savings**: No unnecessary OpenAI API calls for qualification/mandatory/NTH when general criteria fail
- **Faster Results**: Immediate rejection instead of full pipeline processing

## Deployment Commands
See `vm_commands_v12b.txt` for complete deployment instructions.

## Testing Recommendation
Test with a company that has headquarters in China/Iran/Russia to verify:
1. General criteria shows "Fail"
2. No qualification_results populated
3. No detailed_results for any audiences
4. Final status: "NOT QUALIFIED - Failed General Criteria"

## Version History
- v12a: Fixed OpenAI token limits and progress tracking
- v12b: Fixed general criteria early exit logic (this version)
