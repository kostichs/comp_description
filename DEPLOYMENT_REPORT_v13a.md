# Deployment Report v13a - URL Validation & Data Alignment Fixes

**Release Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Docker Image:** `sergeykostichev/company-canvas-app:v13a`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Successfully Built and Pushed to Docker Hub

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. URL Validation Logic Fix üîß
**Problem:** Dead links were incorrectly marked as alive and processed
- ScrapingBee returned HTTP 200 for non-existent domains
- System continued processing with wrong company information
- Test case: "Adidas kjshdfajhds.hddr" was marked as valid

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `normalize_urls.py` with DNS error detection
- Added suspicious response filtering for ScrapingBee results
- Implemented search engine redirect detection
- Dead links now properly filtered out before processing

### 2. Data Alignment Issue Fix üêõ
**Problem:** Company descriptions were written to wrong rows in CSV
- "Adidas" entry received "Chewy, Inc." description
- Results were systematically shifted/offset
- Root cause: Mixed saving order in HubSpot adapter

**Solution:**
- Fixed `merge_original_with_results` function to merge by URL matching
- Modified HubSpot adapter to collect results in memory first
- Implemented ordered saving matching input file order
- URLs now used as unique keys instead of row indices

docker rm company-canvas-app || echo "Container not found"

# Pull new version
docker pull sergeykostichev/company-canvas-app:v13a

# Deploy new container
docker run -d \
  --name company-canvas-app \
  -p 80:8000 \
  -e SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY" \

## Documentation Updates

Updated the following files:
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Updated to v13a references
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Updated deployment commands
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOY_SUMMARY.md` - Added v13a version info
- ‚úÖ `vm_commands_v13a.txt` - Created deployment script

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, test with:

1. **Dead Link Validation:**
   - Upload CSV with intentionally dead links
   - Verify they are filtered out and not processed
   - Check no wrong company information is retrieved

2. **Data Alignment:**
   - Process multiple companies with mixed URL types
   - Verify descriptions match correct company names
   - Check CSV output for proper row alignment

3. **HubSpot Integration:**
   - Test with HubSpot-enabled processing
   - Verify results are saved in correct order
   - Check no data misalignment occurs

## Version Comparison

| Feature | v12a | v13a |
|---------|------|------|
| URL Validation | Basic | Enhanced with DNS detection |
| Data Alignment | Row-based merge | URL-based merge |
| HubSpot Saving | Mixed order | Ordered collection |
| Dead Link Handling | Incorrect | Properly filtered |

## Next Steps

1. Deploy v13a to production VM
2. Test with problematic datasets that failed in previous versions
3. Monitor logs for validation improvements
4. Plan v13b with additional enhancements

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low
- Changes are focused on data processing logic
- No breaking changes to API or UI
- Backward compatible with existing sessions
- Fixes critical data integrity issues

**Rollback Plan:** If issues occur, rollback to v12a using:
```bash
docker stop company-canvas-app && docker rm company-canvas-app
docker run -d [same parameters] sergeykostichev/company-canvas-app:v12a
```
