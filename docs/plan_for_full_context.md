To obtain more complete answers from search models and extract maximum information from found sources, I propose the following options:

1. **Parsing found sources**:
   - Yes, using requests and BeautifulSoup to parse URLs from sources is a very effective approach
   - Can create a new finder `SourceContentFinder` that will take a list of URLs from `LLMDeepSearchFinder` and extract content
   - Important: use your existing ScrapingBeeClient to bypass site restrictions

2. **Multi-stage LLM query process**:
   - First query (current) - getting basic information
   - Second query - gap analysis: "Identify what important information is missing"
   - Third query - targeted search for missing information

3. **Modifying prompt in LLMDeepSearchFinder**:
   - Remove the last part "Provide COMPLETE and THOROUGH information..."
   - Add: "Quote textual fragments from sources and provide exact quotes"
   - Indicate to the model that priority is quantity of information, not its structuring

4. **Processing source content**:
   - Extract text from HTML sources
   - Split into chunks of 8000-10000 characters
   - For each chunk, ask LLM: "Extract all useful information about {company_name} from the following fragment"
   - Combine results into a single document

5. **Modifying URL extractor**:
   - Add parameters to `ScrapingBeeClient` for saving full HTML pages
   - Create local storage for HTML content from sources
   - Implement extraction chain: URL → HTML → text → analytics

6. **Concrete solution for direct implementation**:
```python
async def extract_source_content(sources, company_name, sb_client):
    all_extracted_contents = []
    
    for source in sources:
        url = source.get('url')
        if not url:
            continue
            
        try:
            # Use ScrapingBee to bypass restrictions
            response = sb_client.get(url, params={
                'extract_rules': {'text': 'body'},
                'wait': '5000'
            })
            
            if response.ok:
                # Extract main text
                content = response.text
                
                # If content is too large, split into parts
                if len(content) > 10000:
                    chunks = [content[i:i+10000] for i in range(0, len(content), 10000)]
                else:
                    chunks = [content]
                    
                all_extracted_contents.append({
                    "url": url,
                    "title": source.get('title', 'Unknown'),
                    "content": chunks
                })
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error extracting content from {url}: {e}")
    
    return all_extracted_contents
```

Which of these solutions would you like to implement first?
